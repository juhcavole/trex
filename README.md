In this project, students created a copy of the dinosaur game, famous in Chrome for entertaining us when we are offline. We use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, covering in simple ways several important introductory concepts for web programming such as basic HTML tags, event handling, functions and manipulation of HTML elements using JavaScript, styling and basic animations with CSS.
In addition, students learned how to set up their local environment to write and test their code using javascript, as well as their online game using GitHub.
The students adjusted their game dimensions to fit all screen sizes, built a web wrapper around the app to be able to generate an apk file.
